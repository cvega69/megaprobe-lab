## Weekly update:
#### _TCGAnalysis Project_

### Week 6: (15-19/Jan)

- Continue reading the article about 'Salmon', thanks to the research I did last 
  week on Bayesian Inference, the section called "Online Methods, objectives and 
  mondels for abundance estimation" is a lot easier to read.
- I looked for information on some biology topics, to understand concepts such as 
  nucleotides or transcriptomes    

### Week 5: (8-12/Jan)

- Did research on Bayesian Inference. 
- Also look for information on Expectation-Maximization algorithms

### Week 4: (18-22/Dec)

- Started reading the article titled 
  "Salmon provides accurate, fast, and bias-aware transcript
  expression estimates using dual-phase inference"
- It's a very complicated paper, there are so many concepts I don't understand,
  only in the introduction. 
- I kept reading the same part (introduction) without understanding too much of the 
  information, but finally found a section under the name of 'Algorithms' which 
  resumes pretty much what salmon is about.  

### Week 3: (11-15/Dec)

- Started reproducing the code from the "Processing TCGA mRNA 
  expression data" workshop and had a problem with a missing package 
  called GenomeInfoDbData


### Week 2: (4-8/Dec)

- Reproduce the code from the "Microarray data analysis using 
  Bioconductor" presentation, without any problems

### Week 1: (26/Nov-1/Dec)

- Create GitHub account
- Read Microarray Analysis With Bioconductor Workshop
- Read UPR workshop: Processing TCGA mRNA expression data
